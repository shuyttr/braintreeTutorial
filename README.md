Using the Braintree tutorial as a vehicle to learning more about online payments

## Drop-In Tutorial
I am following the [Drop-in tutorial](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/start/tutorial-drop-in-node) which provides basic understanding of how the client and server work when dealing with Braintree's API.
[See the section "How it Works"](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/start/overview) to get a better understanding of how user's on the client side become authenticated, and how the server sends transactions to Braintree's server.
